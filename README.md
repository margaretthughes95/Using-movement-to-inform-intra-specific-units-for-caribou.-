# Using-movement-to-inform-intra-specific-units-for-caribou.-
Code associated with behavioural analysis of woodland caribou in Western Canada. The paper can be found here: 
The following includes the code that reproduced the statistical analyses for the paper linked above. We used clustering analysis (package: mclust), followed by Principal Component Analysis and Random Forest models (package: randomForest). These packages have useful information about the functions included and should be read up on. I am by no means a stats expert, and this code does not go in-depth into explaining the specifics of the analysis, only what was done through each step for my analysis. This analysis uses behavioural data across multiple individuals that was previously extracted form GPS telemetry data of collared animals. This script does not include that extraction process or cleaning of that data. 
I am more than happy to try to answer questions or help with similar analyses you might be working on, please reach out! margaret.hughes@ucalgary.ca
